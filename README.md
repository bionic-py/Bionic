### About Kiqpo

By making use of [KIQPO](https://github/kiqpo), you can build beautiful, fast, and reliable web applications without relying on [JavaScript](https://github.com/topics/javascript) frameworks, [HTML](https://github.com/topics/HTML) templates, request parsing, or state management. All of this is done using [Python](https://github.com/python) and we're targeting web, [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft), [macOS](https://github.com/topics/macos), [Linux](https://github.com/topics/linux) platforms

### Beautiful user interface
<sub>kiqpo and google's material design </sub>

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
that's why we follow [google](https://github.com/google)'s [material design](https://github.com/material-components) system.

### Productive development

Kiqpo offers hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code and see the results instantly & No HTML/CSS/JavaScript is required for Kiqpo
